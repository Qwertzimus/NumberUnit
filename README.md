# NumberUnit

**NumberUnit goes further and is in the moving process to become a MontiCore standard grammar.**

Therefore, a new version is under test in OCL: https://github.com/MontiCore/OCL/blob/master/src/main/grammars/de/monticore/NumberUnit.mc4
The new version does not introduce tokens anymore and is compatible with the standard MontiCore grammars Type and Literals.

No pull-requests for this grammar will be done in the next 3 weeks. Pull requests will be confirmed after the grammar moved to the new MontiCore version 4.5.5



Support for Numbers with Units:
* 5 m/s^2
* 7/3 N
* -30.4°C
* 0.5 + 0.3i
* 1/3 + 2/3i
* 1’000 km (for better readability)
